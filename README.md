Creating the Registeration/Sign In Page:
Paths:
  1. Create this feature in a standalone application, make sure it works
  2. then link it to my registeration link on the website.
         Possible challenges:
         i. After creating the registeration page in the standalone application and it works on its own,
             How will the integration look like?
             More specifically, what I'm thinking right now is to link the first page of the sign in feature to the link that the Sign Up page of the website links to
             But will this be enough?
             Let's test it out with some random website to see.
               Current challenges afte trying this method:
                   when I tried to test the link by pointing a random website to the path of the button,
                       the website works correctly when i inspect the html in the browswer, however, when i test it locally with nom start, the anchor tag doesn't work
                       Now to try to solve this problem, I will try to host the website through git to see if full page reloads will be allowed
                       If it s allowed, then it it just a problem with npm that i can ignore, if it doesn't then I will have to figuure out a new way to solve this

                         Current Challenge:
                           launch the website on git.
